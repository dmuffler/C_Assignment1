Bubble sort passes through the list comparing two values that are next 
to eachother. If the right value is smaller, the values are switched and 
the indexes are both incremented. Once a whole pass is done, the indexes 
are reset to the beginning of the list and the indexes at the start are 
compared and swapped again if needed. This will continue to occur until the 
dataset is sorted.

sort2 implements a selection sort

Seclection sort starts at the first two indexes. They are compared and 
swapped if the first index is bigger than the next. Then the first and the third
indexes are compared and swapped if needed. This will continue to happen 
until all the values are compared to the first index. Once they all have been
compared to the first index, the beginning index will increment to the second 
index. Then the second is compared with the third, and so on until the list
is in sorted order.
